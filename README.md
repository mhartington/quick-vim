## usage

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mhartington/quick-vim.git

You can reset to the default/previous vim env simply:

And thats it.


[Line 77 and down](https://github.com/mhartington/quick-vim/blob/master/vimrc#L77) provide for simple resets that are comfortable for most people. There are also a few functions in there that show some example of vimL. Nothing to complex, but enough to learn.

Feel free to form, hack, or send PRs.
